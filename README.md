# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-ML
This repository contains a hands-on implementation of Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Our goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, leveraging the power of NLP to understand and interpret human sentiments expressed on social media platforms.

# Key Features:

Data Collection: Gather real-time data using the Twitter API.

Text Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the raw text, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

Sentiment Classification: Implement and compare various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or BERT) to accurately classify sentiments.

Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations to showcase sentiment trends and key insights.


Whether you're a beginner in data science or an experienced coder, this project provides a comprehensive guide to applying NLP and machine learning techniques to real-world data. Gain valuable insights into how businesses and organizations can leverage social media sentiment analysis for better decision-making. ðŸŒŸ[kaggle.json]
